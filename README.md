## Real-time Data Aquisition and Embedded Software Enthusiast

---
### A few projects I've had the opportunity to work on,

### Penn Trigger Board (PTB)
A physical interface for an AMD/Xilinx ZYNQ SoC performing data selection at three international particle physics experiments. The hardware, firmware, and 
software are all custom designed and built. [link] An example of its integration into the wider data aquisiton for the DUNE experiment 
[repo link](https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/ctbmodules).

### DUNE GPS Interface Board (GIB)
An interface to the GPS system to give precise absolute timestamps for the DUNE experiment. Built the hardware, firmware, software for the initial version.
Documentation for the hardware and using the board can be found [at this link](https://jsensenig.github.io/GIB-Documentation/).

### GRAMS Data Aquisition
NASA-funded balloon gamma-ray telescope. Designing/writing the high-throughput, power constrained [data aquisition system](https://github.com/NevisNeutrinos/GramsReadout) and [telemetry format](https://github.com/NevisNeutrinos/PGramsCommCodec) and [decoding](https://github.com/NevisNeutrinos/readout_decoder) of binary data from the telescope.
